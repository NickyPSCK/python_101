    "\n",
    "Information stored in files can be accessed by a Python program. To get access to the contents of a file, you need to <em style=\"color:blue\">open</em> the file in your program. When you are done using a file, you should <em style=\"color:blue\">close</em> it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Opening a File\n",
    "Python has a built-in function `open()` that can open a file for reading and writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The form of `open` is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = open(filename, mode)\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### `filename` is:\n",
    "- The name of the file if the file is saved in the same directory as your program.\n",
    "- However, if it is not saved in the same directory, you must provide the path to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `mode` can be: \n",
    "- `'r'` when the file will only be read, \n",
    "- `'w'` for only writing (an existing file with the same name will be erased), and \n",
    "- `'a'` opens the file for appending; any data written to the file is automatically added to the end.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The mode argument is optional; `'r'` will be assumed if it is omitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `open()` returns a file object. \n",
    "- This object knows how to get information from the file, and  keeps track of how much you have read and which part of the file you are about to read next. \n",
    "- The marker that keeps track of the current location in the file is called a <em style=\"color:blue\">file cursor</em> and acts much like a bookmark. \n",
    "- The file cursor is initially at the beginning of the file, but as we read or write data it moves to the end of what we just read or wrote.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Closing a File\n",
